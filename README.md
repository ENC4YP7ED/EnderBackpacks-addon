# Ender Backpacks for Dummies

An addon mod for **Backpack for Dummies** that adds Ender-themed backpacks with a distinctive teal/cyan color scheme.

## Features

- **Ender Backpack**: A special variant that functions like an Ender Chest
  - **Synced with Ender Chest**: Each player sees their own ender chest inventory when opening any ender backpack
  - **Personal Storage**: When you open someone else's ender backpack, you see YOUR items, not theirs
  - **Universal Access**: Access your ender chest contents from any ender backpack, anywhere
  - Default teal color (#136157) applied on crafting
- Fully compatible with all Backpack for Dummies features:
  - Place and pick up ender backpacks
  - Works with both chest armor slot and Accessories API
  - Dye-able with any color
  - Open with keybinding (default: B) when equipped
  - Click on someone's back to access YOUR ender chest
- Crafted by surrounding a regular backpack with ender pearls

## How It Works

The Ender Backpack works exactly like a vanilla Ender Chest:

1. **Personal Inventory**: Each player has their own 27-slot ender chest inventory
2. **Synced Storage**: Opening any ender backpack shows YOUR ender chest contents
3. **Multiplayer Friendly**: Other players can't see or access your items
4. **Block & Item Forms**:
   - Place an ender backpack as a block - anyone can open it to access their own ender chest
   - Wear an ender backpack - press B to access your ender chest
   - See someone wearing an ender backpack? Click their back to access YOUR ender chest

- **Minecraft 1.21.1**
- **NeoForge 21.1.0 or higher**
- **Backpack for Dummies** (main mod - REQUIRED)
